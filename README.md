# AI and ML applied to the education field (Bachelor Thesis)
This project is the application of what I learned about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques during my bachelor studies. The area I chose is education, so everything that regards school and students, because of its key importance for our society and our future. The main idea was to work on a dataset (that you can consult in tis repository) that delves into Student Performance, exploring both academic and social factors influencing students' academic performance. The goal was to identify correlations between specific features and predict how good the academic performance of a student could be based on some specific characteristic known in advance, in order to potentially gain valuable insights on what contributes to academic success.

In this repository you can find the following:
- Dataset containing the students' information;
- Full python code;
- Final work (complete bachelor thesis report).
