# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning applied to the education field
This project is the application of what I learned about AI and ML techniques during my bachelor studies. The area I chose is education, so everything that regards school and students, because of its key importance for our society and our future. The main idea was to work on a dataset (that you can consult in tis repository) that delves into Student Performance, exploring both academic and social factors influencing students' academic performance. Some of the academic indicators reported are the department the students are enrolled in, their performance metrics (CGPA, as well as scores obtained after secondary and higher secondary education) and their proficiency in specific skills (as computer or language).
Other than those features, the dataset also considers the social extraction of the students and everything that characterizes their life beyond the school. The goal was to identify correlations between specific features and predict how good the academic performance of a student could be based on some specific characteristic known in advance, in order to potentially gain valuable insights on what contributes to academic success.
